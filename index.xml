      <description>Supplementary Material #  On this page, I will post additional resources and supplementary material for the course.
Resources for R #  In this course, we will use R as the main computational tool. Below are some resources:
 R for Data Science by Grolemund and Wickham. Hands-On Programming with R by Grolemund. Jenny Bryan&amp;rsquo;s course on Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R  In particular, I recommend the notes on The Many Flavours of R objects   Mine Cetinkaya&amp;rsquo;s curated list of resources for R If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a deep understanding of R, I recommend Hadley Wickham&amp;rsquo;s book Advanced R RStudio has several great cheatsheets on their website.</description>
