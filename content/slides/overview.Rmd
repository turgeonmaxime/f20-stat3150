## Course Objectives

  - Broad overview of techniques used in multivariate analysis, with emphasis on **Multivariate Linear Regression** and **Principal Component Analysis**.
    1. Make decisions on how and when to use the techniques discussed in class;
    2. Apply and assess multivariate methods on real data;
    3. Make sound statistical conclusions based on a multivariate analysis.
  - Make you competent in the `R` statistical software.

## Tentative topics {.allowframebreaks}

  - *Aspects of multivariate analysis* (Chapter 1)
  - *Matrix algebra and random vectors* (Chapter 2)
  - *Random Samples* (Chapter 3)
  - *Multivariate normal distribution* (Chapter 4)
  - *Inferences about a mean vector* (Chapter 5)
  - *Multivariate linear regression* (Chapter 7)
  - *Principal Component Analysis* (Chapter 8)
  - *Factor Analysis* (Chapter 9)
  - *Canonical Correlation Analysis* (Chapter 10)
  - Kernel methods and Manifold Learning (if time permits)

## Multivariate Data

  - Multivariate data is **everywhere**
    + Multiple measurements collected a on given experimental unit
  - Multivariate analysis is concerned with the relationship between those variables
  - **Note**: Regression with a single outcome variable is *not* considered multivariate analysis.

## Multivariate Methods

  - One- or two-sample inference about multivariate data (think t-test)
  - *MANOVA*: Generalization to several populations
  - **Multivariate Linear Regression**: Linear model for multivariate response in terms of covariates
  
## Multivariate Methods

  - **Principal Component Analysis**: Reduce dimension of data by finding directions in data with maximal variance
  - *Factor Analysis*: Understand variance in multivariate sample in terms of latent (i.e. unobserved) factors
  - *Canonical Correlation Analysis*: Study correlations between two multivariate datasets
  
## Multivariate Methods (**not** covered in STAT 4690)

  - Methods for longitudinal data (e.g. mixed-effect models or GEEs)
  - *Clustering*: Grouping "similar" observations based on their (multivariate) measurement (STAT 4600: Statistical Learning)
  - *Classification and Discrimination*: Grouping observations and allocating new units to previously defined classes (STAT 4600: Statistical Learning)
    + The difference between the last two is whether or not we measured a class label for the observations.
    
## Statistical analysis

  - This is an *applied* course, so we will be analysing data
    + Although we also require a fair amount of theory
  - We will mostly use `R`, and the datasets will be provided to you.
    + Code for in-class examples will also be provided
  - For assignments and course project, students are *strongly* encouraged to use `Rmarkdown` or `knitr`.
    + Literate programming
    + Reproducibility
