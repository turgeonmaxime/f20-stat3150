## Lecture Objectives

  - Describe the main differences between computer arithmetic and "normal" arithmetic.
  - Apply root finding methods for one-dimensional problems.

## Motivation

  - Over the last few weeks, we discussed resampling methods.
    + Useful for studying the sampling distribution of estimators and test statistics.
  - For the next three weeks, we will discuss **numerical methods** and **optimisation**
    + These methods can be used to *compute* estimators.
  - Data analysis often combines both approaches.
    + Estimation and inference.
    
## Question

  - Can you give examples of estimators defined by solving an equation $f(x) = c$?
  - Can you recall an example from the notes/assignments?
  
## Testing equality {.allowframebreaks}

  - To test for equality of integers, booleans or strings, we can use `==`.
    + `3 == 4`, `TRUE == FALSE`, `"hello" == "world"`.
  - But with decimal numbers, the equality operator may behave in surprising ways
  
```{r}
# Expected
(0.5 + 0.5) == 1

# Unexpected
(0.1 + 0.2) == 0.3

# Why?
0.3 - (0.1 + 0.2)
```

\vspace{1cm}

  - In computer's memory, decimal numbers are represented in binary scientific notation.
    + Which leads to rounding errors that may be hard to predict.
  - `R` gives us two functions to test equality more carefully:
    + `all.equal`: Tests for "near equality", i.e. within a tolerance level
    + `identical`: Tests for whether two objects are identical (including length, attributes, etc.).
    
\vspace{2cm}
    
```{r}
all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
identical(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
```

\vspace{2cm}

```{r}
# But be careful!
all.equal(1, 2)
# Better
isTRUE(all.equal(1, 2))
```

\vspace{1cm}

  - Another approach: check whether `abs(x - y) < epsilon`, for an `epsilon` of your choice.
  
```{r}
abs(0.3 - (0.2 + 0.1)) < 10^-10
```

## Overflow and underflow

  - Another way in which computer arithmetic can be surprising: very small and very large numbers.
    + Small numbers may be rounded down to zero.
    + Large numbers will be turn into `Inf`.
  - In both cases, there are two strategies that can help:
    + Simplify expressions by hand as much as you can first: $\frac{n!}{(n - 2)!} = n(n-1)$.
    + Compute on logarithmic scale, and convert answer back to original scale with `exp`.
    
## Example {.allowframebreaks}

  - We know the Poisson mass function is
  $$P(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{k}}{k!} > 0.$$

  - But when $k$ is large, we may run into underflow issues.

\vspace{1cm}

```{r}
dpois(100, lambda = 1)
dpois(200, lambda = 1)
# Use logarithms
dpois(200, lambda = 1, log = TRUE)
```

## Exercise

Using the properties of logarithms, evaluate
$$\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n - 1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{n - 2}{2}\right)},$$
for $n=400$. Use `lgamma` to evaluate the Gamma function on the logarithmic scale.

## Solution

```{r}
n <- 400
# With gamma
(gamma(0.5*(n-1))/(gamma(0.5)*gamma(0.5*(n-2))))
# With lgamma
exp(lgamma(0.5*(n-1)) - lgamma(0.5) - lgamma(0.5*(n-2)))
```

## Finding the roots of a function

  - The first class of numerical methods we will look at our **root finding algorithms** (in one dimension).
  - Assume we have a continuous function $f(x)$ of one variable. For a given constant $c$, we want to find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = c$.
    + Equivalent to replacing $f(x)$ with $f^\prime(x) = f(x) - c$ and looking for when $f^\prime(x) = 0$.
  - We will look at two methods:
    + Bisection method
    + Brent's method

## Bisection method {.allowframebreaks}

  - Assume that we have $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are nonzero and have opposite sign.
    + Exactly one is negative, the other is positive.
  - Because $f$ is continuous, the *Intermediate Value Theorem* tells us that there must be a value $x\in (a, b)$ such that $f(x) = 0$.
    + It may not be unique, but there's at least one such $x$.

\vspace{3cm}
    
  - With the bisection method, we look at the mid-point of $[a, b]$: $x_1 = \frac{b-1}{2}$, and we evaluate $f(x_1)$.
    + If $f(a)$ and $f(x_1)$ have the **same sign**, then the root is in the interval $(x_1, b)$.
    + If $f(a)$ and $f(x_1)$ have **opposite sign**, then the root is in the interval $a, x_1)$.
  - We then repeat the process on the new interval, which gives us a sequence of "guesses" $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots$.
    + This sequence is **guaranteed** to converge to a root of $f(x) = 0$.
  - We stop when we are "close enough", i.e. when $\lvert f(x_n) \rvert < \epsilon$.

## Example {.allowframebreaks}

  - We will look at the function 
  $$f(x) = a^2 + x^2 + \frac{2ax}{n-1} - (n - 2),$$
  for $a=0.5$ and $n=20$, on the interval $(0, 5n)$.
  
```{r}
a <- 0.5
n <- 20
# First create a function
fun <- function(x) {
  a^2 + x^2 + 2*a*x/(n-1) - n + 2
}
```

```{r}
# Check output at interval bounds
x_lb <- 0 # Lower bound
x_ub <- 5*n # Upper bound

c(fun(x_lb), fun(x_ub))
```

```{r}
# Set up----
x_next <- 0.5*(x_ub - x_lb) + x_lb # Midpoint
epsilon <- 10^-10
f_lb <- fun(x_lb)
f_ub <- fun(x_ub)
f_next <- fun(x_next)
iterations <- 0
```

```{r}
while(abs(f_next) > epsilon) {
  iterations <- iterations + 1
  if (f_ub*f_next > 0) {
    x_ub <- x_next # same sign, move left
  } else {
    x_lb <- x_next # opposite sign, move right
    }
  x_next <- 0.5*(x_ub - x_lb) + x_lb
  f_next <- fun(x_next)
}
```


```{r}
# Our estimate the solution f(x) = 0
x_next
# Number of iterations
iterations
```


## Exercise

Use the bisection method to find the solution to the equation
$$ \cos(x) = x^3.$$

## Solution {.allowframebreaks}

  - First, we can look at the solution of $g(x) = 0$, for $g(x) = \cos(x) - x^3$.
  - Based on our knowledge of these two functions, we deduce that a solution, if it exists, must be positive.
  - Let's look at the interval $[0, 2]$

```{r}
# First create a function
g_fun <- function(x) {
  cos(x) - x^3
}
```

```{r}
# Check output at interval bounds
x_lb <- 0 # Lower bound
x_ub <- 2 # Upper bound

c(g_fun(x_lb), g_fun(x_ub))
```

```{r}
# Set up----
x_next <- 0.5*(x_ub - x_lb) + x_lb # Midpoint
epsilon <- 10^-10
g_lb <- g_fun(x_lb)
g_ub <- g_fun(x_ub)
g_next <- g_fun(x_next)
iterations <- 0
```

```{r}
while(abs(g_next) > epsilon) {
  iterations <- iterations + 1
  if (g_ub*g_next > 0) {
    x_ub <- x_next # same sign, move left
  } else {
    x_lb <- x_next # opposite sign, move right
    }
  x_next <- 0.5*(x_ub - x_lb) + x_lb
  g_next <- g_fun(x_next)
}
```


```{r}
# Our estimate the solution g(x) = 0
x_next
# Number of iterations
iterations
```

```{r}
# Plot functions to check
xseq <- seq(-2, 2, length.out = 100)
plot(xseq, cos(xseq), type = "l")
lines(xseq, xseq^3)
abline(v = x_next, lty = 2)
```


## Brent's method {.allowframebreaks}

  - The bisection method is guaranteed to converge.
    + Intermediate Value Theorem
  - But convergence can be slow...
    + For an initial interval of length $L$, after $n$ step the bracketing interval has length $L/2^n$.
  - Other methods (e.g. secant method) can converge faster, but they're not guaranteed to converge...
  - **Brent's method** combines the convergence speed of these methods, but guarantees convergence by keeping the root within a shrinking interval.
  - I will broadly describe the algorithm, but you are not expected to implement it. We will use `R`'s implementation.
  
### Algorithm (Broadly speaking)

Start with interval $[a, b]$ and continuous function $f(x)$. The values $f(a),f(b)$ have opposite signs.

  1. Define a third point $(c, f(c))$, where $c$ is the value at which a linear interpolation crosses the x-axis. Depending on the sign of $f(c)$, we know the solution $f(x) = 0$ falls inside the interval $(a,c)$ or $(c,b)$.
  2. Fit a sideways parabola to all three points, and find the intersection $x_1$ with the x-axis. If $x_1$ falls outside the interval from Step 1, replace $x_1$ by the midpoint of the interval (i.e. bisection).
  3. Repeat until convergence.

## Example {.allowframebreaks}

  - We will use the same example as above: 
  $$f(x) = a^2 + x^2 + \frac{2ax}{n-1} - (n - 2),$$
  for $a=0.5$ and $n=20$, on the interval $(0, 5n)$.
  
```{r}
a <- 0.5
n <- 20
# Create a function
fun <- function(x) {
  a^2 + x^2 + 2*a*x/(n-1) - n + 2
}
```

  - We will use the function `uniroot` in `R`:
    + The first argument is the function $f(x)$.
    + The second argument is the interval $[a,b]$.
    + The argument `tol` controls the convergence.
    
```{r}
output <- uniroot(f = fun,

## Exercise

Use Brent's method to find the root of 
$$ f(x) = e^{-x}\left(3.2\sin(x) - 0.5\cos(x)\right),$$
on the interval $[3, 4]$.

## Solution

```{r}
result <- uniroot(function(x) {
  exp(-x)*(3.2*sin(x) - 0.5*cos(x))
  }, interval = c(3, 4))

result$root
```

## Summary

  - We discussed some important differences between computer arithmetic and "normal" arithmetic.
    + Rounding errors
    + Overflow and underflow
  - We introduced two methods for finding roots $f(x) = 0$ in one-dimension.
    + Why can't we apply these methods in higher dimensions?
  - On Thursday, we will see how this can be applied to **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**.
