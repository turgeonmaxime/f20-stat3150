## Problem 1

In the lecture notes on Permutation tests, I mentioned that bootstrap hypothesis tests tend to be less powerful than permutation tests. Design and conduct a simulation study to compare the power between a bootstrap and permutation test, using a difference of means as the test statistic.

You will need to specify the following quantities:

  - The number of simulations $N$.
  - The sample sizes $n_X, n_Y$ of both samples.
  - The distribution $F_X$ of the sample $X_1, \ldots, X_{n_X}$.
  - The distribution $F_Y$ of the sample $Y_1, \ldots, Y_{n_Y}$.
  - The difference $\Delta = \mu_X - \mu_Y$ between the population means.

## Problem 2

Show that the following statistics lead to equivalent permutation tests for the equality of two population means: 

  a) the sum of the observations in the smallest sample; 
  b) the difference between the sample means;
  c) the t-statistic. 

In other words, given a set of permutations of the data and signifance level $\alpha$, one of these tests will reject the null hypothesis if and only if all tests reject the null hypothesis.

**Hint**: The sum of all the observations, the sum of the squares of all the observations, and the sample sizes are invariant under permutations.

## Problem 3

Let $A$ be an invertible matrix of dimension $p\times p$. One way to estimate the inverse of the matrix $A$ is via the following algorithm: Start with an initial value $B_0$, and define the following sequence:

$$ B_{n+1} = 2B_n - B_n A B_n, \quad n\geq 0.$$

Implement this algorithm to find the inverse of the following matrix:

```{r}
Amat <- matrix(c(1, 0.7, 0.7, 1), ncol = 2)
Amat
```

Check your solution using the function `solve`, or by computing the products $AA^{1}$ and $A^{-1}A$.

## Problem 4

Write a function in `R` to compute the CDF of the Cauchy distribution, which has density
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\theta \pi\left(1 + \left(\frac{x - \eta}{\theta}\right)^2\right)}, \qquad x\in\mathbb{R}.$$
Your function should be valid for all $\theta > 0$ and $\eta \in \mathbb{R}$, within numerical limits. Compare your results to the results from the `R` function `pcauchy`.

## Problem 5

Let $Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ be a sample from a multinomial distribution on 3 objects. In other words:
$$ P(Y_i = k) = \pi_k, \qquad k = 1, 2, 3.$$

  a. Explain why we can treat this multinomial model as a 2 parameter model.
  b. Write down the log-likelihood for this data.
  c. Compute the first-order partial derivatives for the log-likelihood.
  d. Compute the second-order partial derivatives for the log-likelihood.
  e. Use the Newton-Raphson algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimate for the data in `mtcars$cyl`.

## Problem 6

This problem uses ideas from numerical methods, and it lets you practice your `R` coding skills, but it is slightly outside the scope for STAT 3150. So attempt at your own risk.

One approach to finding the leading eigenvector and its corresponding eigenvalue (i.e. the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue) is the *power method*:

  - *Input*: A real symmetric matrix $A$ with distinct eigenvalues; a tolerance $\epsilon > 0$; maximum number of iteration $N$.
  - *Output*: The leading eigenvalue $\lambda$ and a corresponding eigenvector $v$.
  - Randomly initialized $v_0$.
  - For $i = 1:N$,
    + $v_{i} = Av_{i-1}$;
    + $v_{i} \leftarrow \frac{v_i}{\|v_i\|}$;
    + If $\|v_{i} - v_{i-1}\| < \epsilon$, `break` out of the loop; otherwise continue.
   - Set $v = v_K$, where $K$ is the iteration at which we broke out, or $N$.
   - Set $\lambda = \frac{v^TAv}{v^Tv}$.

Let $A$ be a real positive-definite matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1>\ldots>\lambda_p$ and corresponding eigenvectors $v_1,\ldots,v_p$. 

We will use the following positive-definite matrix:

```{r}
Amat <- matrix(c(1, 0.7, 0.5,
                 0.7, 1, 0.7,
                 0.5, 0.7, 1), 
               ncol = 3)
Amat
```

Implement the power method to find the leading eigenvector and eigenvalue of the matrix `Amat`. You can check your work using the function `eigen`, but remember that orthonormal eigenvectors are only unique up to $\pm 1$.

## Problem 7

This problem is a continuation of Problem 6. We explore how the power method can be used to find the other eigenvectors and eigenvalues of `Amat`.

  a. Let $A$ be a general positive-definite matrix of dimension $p$. Show that, for all $j=1,\ldots,p$, $v_j$ is an eigenvector of $A^{-1}$ with eigenvalue $\lambda_j^{-1}$.
  b. Using the result above, explain how you can adapt the power algorithm to find $\lambda_p$ and $v_p$ (i.e. the smallest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector).
  c. Let $d\in\mathbb{R}$ be a real number. Give the eigendecomposition of $(A - d I)^{-1}$.
  d. Using the result above, explain how you can adapt the power algorithm to find the other eigenvalues $\lambda_2 > \ldots > \lambda_{p-1}$ and eigenvectors $v_2 > \ldots > v_{p-1}$ of $A$. (*Hint*: Think about the case $p=3$ first, and extrapolate from there.)
  e. Using `R`, verify your algorithms from parts b and d on the matrix `Amat`. Validate your answer using the function `eigen`.
