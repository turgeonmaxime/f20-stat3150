# General Information

This is the course website for **STAT 3150: Statistical Computing**. This course aims to provide students with a broad overview of computational techniques used in modern statistical analysis. Throughout the course, students will:

 - Become proficient in R, to the level that they can analyse data using the tools from this class.
 - Be able to choose and produce an appropriate data visualization given the context.
 - Learn how to sample from various distributions, directly and indirectly.
 - Become familiar with several resampling techniques and know which one to use for a particular problem.
 - Be introduced to numerical methods and optimisation techniques.

### Prerequisites

STAT 2150 (Statistics and Computing) and STAT 2400 (Introduction to Probability 1)

### Textbook

*Statistical Computing with R* (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.) by Maria L. Rizzo, CRC Press, 2019.

The textbook is not required but strongly recommended.

### Assessments

The assessments for this course include:

  - Six (6) assignments.

  - One (1) final exam.

## Outline of Topics

The course is expected to cover the following topics:

  - Data Visualization (Chapter 5)
  - Generating Random Variables (Chapter 3)
  - Monte Carlo Integration (Chapter 6)
  - Importance Sampling (Chapter 6)
  - Monte Carlo Methods for Inference (Chapter 7)
  - Bootstrap and Jackknife (Chapter 8)

  - Numerical Methods (Chapter 13)
  - Introduction to Optimisation (Chapter 14)

## Statistical Software

The course requires you to make extensive use of the R statistical software for your assignments and final data project. Sample codes will be provided to students. 

You can download R for free (for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Solaris) from the *Comprehensive R Archive Network* at: https://cran.r-project.org/

For additional resources on R, see [here]({{< ref "suppl.md" >}}).
