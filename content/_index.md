# General Information

This is the course website for **STAT 3150: Statistical Computing**. This course aims to provide students with a broad overview of computational techniques used in modern statistical analysis. Throughout the course, students will:

 - Become proficient in R, to the level that they can analyse data using the tools from this class.
 - Be able to choose and produce an appropriate data visualization given the context.
 - Learn how to sample from various distributions, directly and indirectly.
 - Become familiar with several resampling techniques and know which one to use for a particular problem.
 - Be introduced to numerical methods and optimisation techniques.

# Outline of Topics

The course is expected to cover the following topics:

  - Data Visualization (Chapter 5)
  - Generating Random Variables (Chapter 3)
  - Monte Carlo Integration (Chapter 6)
  - Important Sampling (Chapter 6)
  - Monte Carlo Methods for Inference (Chapter 7)
